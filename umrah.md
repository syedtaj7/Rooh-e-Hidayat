"Here I am ! O Allah ! Here I am ! Here I am there is no one who is Your Partner, Here I am ! surely, all praise and blessings are Yours, and Dominion. You are without Companion"

8) WAY TO JOURNEY

Pilgrims proceeding by Air for Hajj / Umrah from Hyderabad, Bangalore, Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, etc will wear Ihraam from their places of residential cities. These cities will become similar to Meeqat.

9) MEEQAT

There are two types of Meeqat.
a) Meeqat Makani    b) Meeqat Zamani.

Meeqat Makani means the place where after reaching, the pilgrims will wear Ihraam for Hajj or Umrah or for both.

Meeqat Zamani (Period) means, it is that period in which Hajj is necessary. Or in other
words wearing Ihraam for Hajj is Mustahab in the months of Hajj and it is Makruh to wear Ihraam for Hajj in other months. It is the saying of Allah:

الحَجُّ أَشْهُرٌ مَّعْلُومَاتٌ

"Period of Hajj is known months" i.e. months of Shawwal, Zeeqadah and till 10th of Dhul Hijja.

Natives of INDIA have the Meeqat boundary at YALAMLAM on the way to Jeddah which is 75 miles before Jeddah. Pilgrims travelling by AIR will have difficulty in wearing Ihraam exactly at YALAMLAM inside the aircraft which is practically not possible.

10) START OF JOURNEY

From the residential place of city, Pilgrims will be travelling by Aeroplanes to Jeddah or Madinah. On reaching the Airports of Jeddah or Madinah, they will have to meet the Muallim whose name is endorsed in the Passport and complete the formalities with him. After reaching Jeddah the Pilgrims will proceed to Holy Makkah by Taxi and reach their place of stay. For Hajj, the pilgrims will stay in the designated building rented by Muallim. One wrist belt will be given to each pilgrim by the
Muallim for the Hajj pilgrims. It has to be worn till the journey home country is undertaken.

11) ENTERING IN THE MASJID UL HARAM

In normal times after reaching Makkah Mouzzama, room is taken on hire by the Pilgrim of UMRAH and the luggage is kept safely in the room. After this Pilgrim will enter MASJID UL HARAM (Baithullah) from BAB US SALAM or any other doors. It is Masnoon to put the right foot first in Haram and say:

اللّهُمَّ افْتَحْ لِي أَبْوَابَ رَحْمَتِكَ

"O Allah I seek forgiveness for all sins and request You to expand the doors of Mercy on me".

12) SUPPLICATIONS AFTER SEEING HOLY KAABA

The moment after entering Masjid Ul Haram, Pilgrims while going near to KAABA in Mataf should stop on the way for a while as they see Holy KAABA and offer three times the TAKBIR. During the recitation of TAKBIR keep the sight fixed on Holy KAABA.
اللّهُ أَكْبَرُ اللّهُ أَكْبَرُ اللّهُ أَكْبَرُ
لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللّهُ وَاللّهُ أَكْبَرُ
اللّهُ أَكْبَرُ وَلِلَّهِ الْحَمْدُ

"Allah is Great ! Allah is Great ! Allah is Great !
None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and He is Great".

Keep your sight fixed on Holy Kaaba and do this supplication that O ALLAH! accept this supplication that hereafter, whatever justified supplication I do is accepted i.e. to make me Mustajab Daawaat.

13) ISTELAM OF HAJRE ASWAD
(Touching or Kissing)

Now the pilgrim should move towards HAJRE ASWAD and if no place is available near it, Pilgrim should stand in the direction of HAJRE ASWAD, so that the left of HAJRE ASWAD is onto the right side of the right shoulder of the Pilgrim. Now the pilgrim should do IDTIBA (The one end of upper cloth sheet of Ihraam should be taken from underneath the right armpit and put on to the top of the left shoulder). This way right hand and right shoulder is not covered and they are free from the cloth.

14) TAWAF

Before starting of Tawaf, recitation of Talbiyah
shall be stopped. Niyyat (Intention) of Tawaf is now done (It is Farz).

اللّهُمَّ إِنِّي أُرِيدُ طَوَافَ بَيْتِكَ الْحَرَامِ فَيَسِّرْهُ لِي وَتَقَبَّلْهُ مِنِّي

"O ALLAH! I desire to perform Tawaf of Your Sacred House. So make it easy for me and accept it from me".

Now move, slightly towards the right side and be opposite to HAJRE ASWAD (coming in straight line of Hajre Aswad), raise your hands like in Namaz upto your ears and palms facing Hajre Aswad, read Takbir and Hamd.

بِسْمِ اللّهِ اللّهُ أَكْبَرُ وَلِلَّهِ الْحَمْدُ

"In the name of Allah, Allah is Great and all Praise is due to Allah alone".

After this drop down the hands and come to Hajre Aswad and kiss it in a humble manner. If due to rush, kissing of Hajre Aswad is not possible then touch it and kiss the palms. If still due to rush going near Hajre Aswad is not possible then from a distance only do ISTELAM (Make indication of touching Hajre Aswad by your hands and then kiss the palms). If in the hand there is a stick, then touch
Hajre Aswad with the stick and kiss the stick which is Mustahab. While doing ISTELAM or kissing Hajre Aswad pilgrim should say:

بِسْمِ اللّهِ اللّهُ أَكْبَرُ

and it is Masnun. While passing from Hajre Aswad keep your face straight and walk in such a way that Holy Kaaba will be on the left side. While doing Tawaf do not turn your face/chest towards Holy Kaaba, because it is Makruh-e-Tahreemi. If by chance face/chest is turned towards Holy Kaaba, then that much portion of the Shawt (circuit) should be redone. Now start the Tawaf from the right side of Hajre Aswad i.e. passing through Multazim, door of Baithullah, Hateem and Rukn-e-Yamani and then complete the circuit at Hajre Aswad. In the first three Circuits male Pilgrims will do RAMAL. (It is to walk hurriedly with forceful and narrow paces starting from Hajre Aswad and ending at Hajre Aswad). While doing Tawaf in every circuit at Rukn-e-Yamani (the last corner of Holy Kaaba before you reach Hajre Aswad) touch and feel it and then proceed ahead. Due to heavy rush if it is not possible then Pilgrim should do ISTELAM. Here also the chest should not face the Holy Kaaba. Between Rukn-e-Yamani and Hajre Aswad recite this supplication.
رَبَّنَا آتِنَا فِي الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِي الآخِرَةِ حَسَنَةً وَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ

"Our Lord! give us goodness in this world and goodness hereafter, and save us from the chastisement of fire and enter us in Paradise alongwith the righteous ones, O Powerful, O All Forgiving, O Lord of the Universe".

15) TAWAF-E-BAITHULLAH
